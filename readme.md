```
How do I use it?
----------------
First, install it by running this command in KoLmafia's graphical CLI:

```
git checkout https://github.com/infopowerbroker/ami_wrapper.git release
```

 
Add the following as a custom daily deed:
```
$CUSTOM|Command|Run Ami_Wrapper|z_Ami_Wrapper|call Ami_wrapper.ash|||,
```

More information about custom daily deeds can be found on the Wiki: https://wiki.kolmafia.us/index.php/Daily_Deeds

To add the daily deed, close down mafia and edit the file GLOBAL_prefs.txt in settings/
Make a backup copy first. Also make sure your editor isn't set to word wrap (not clear on how that works).
Find the line that starts with dailyDeedsOptions= and add a comma and the custom deed you want to the end of the line. You can reorder the lines easily in mafia, once you restart it.
